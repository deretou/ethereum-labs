Lab 5.1 : Inheritence
======================

## Objective

In this lab we will learn about OOP and inheritance for smart contracts.

## Our Current Contract

Just for purposes of reference, our current Solidity contract looks like this:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.18;

contract Jobs {
    
    struct Employee {
        uint age;
        string fName;
        string lName;
    }
    
    mapping (address => Employee) employees;
    address[] public employeeAccts;
    
    function setEmployee(address _address, uint _age, string _fName, string _lName) public {
        var employee = employees[_address];
        
        employee.age = _age;
        employee.fName = _fName;
        employee.lName = _lName;
        
        employeeAccts.push(_address) -1;
    }
    
    function getEmployees() view public returns(address[]) {
        return employeeAccts;
    }
    
    function getEmployee(address _address) view public returns (uint, string, string) {
        return (employees[_address].age, employees[_address].fName, employees[_address].lName);
    }
    
    function countEmployees() view public returns (uint) {
        return employeeAccts.length;
    }
    
}
```
## Creating a Base Contract

A common pattern in smart contracts when it concerns inheritance is to define an owner address and a modifier that gives only the smart contract owner address the ability to access certain functions.

Above the contract Jobs { line, we're going to create a new base contract for that purpose:
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.18;

contract Owned {
    address owner;
    
    function Owned() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
   modifier onlyOwner {
       require(msg.sender == owner);
       _;
   }
}

contract Jobs is Owned {

// Other code removed for brevity
```
If you followed along with this course, you'll notice that the code in the Owned contract is familiar. We're setting the owner address to the creator of the contract, and a modifier.

Also, note that we added is Owned onto the contract Jobs line. That's how you make a contract inherit from a base contract.

We can assure that this works by adding the onlyOwner modifier to the setEmployee function in the derived contract:

```solidity
// Other code removed for brevity

function setEmployee(address _address, uint _age, bytes16 _fName, bytes16 _lName) onlyOwner public {

// Other code removed for brevity
```
If you create this contract and try to set an employee as we've been doing in this previous lessons, it will only work if you set it with the address that was used to deploy the contract.

This works because our Jobs contracted inherits from the Owned contract.

## Changing from Strings to Bytes

Our smart contract consists of two strings first name and last name. Strings are costworthy on the Ethereum blockchain, and when possible, you should actually use type of bytes.

Modify the smart contract so that each reference of first and last name, is no longer a type of string, but bytes16 instead.

Here is the full contract with all of those changes made:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.18;

contract Owned {
    address owner;
    
    function Owned() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
   modifier onlyOwner {
       require(msg.sender == owner);
       _;
   }
}

contract Jobs is Owned {
    
    struct Employee {
        uint age;
        bytes16 fName;
        bytes16 lName;
    }
    
    mapping (address => Employee) employees;
    address[] public employeeAccts;
    
    event employeeInfo(
       bytes16 fName,
       bytes16 lName,
       uint age
    );
    
    function setEmployee(address _address, uint _age, bytes16 _fName, bytes16 _lName) onlyOwner public {
        var employee = employees[_address];
        
        employee.age = _age;
        employee.fName = _fName;
        employee.lName = _lName;
        
        employeeAccts.push(_address) -1;
        employeeInfo(_fName, _lName, _age);
    }
    
    function getEmployees() view public returns(address[]) {
        return employeeAccts;
    }
    
    function getEmployee(address _address) view public returns (uint, bytes16, bytes16) {
        return (employees[_address].age, employees[_address].fName, employees[_address].lName);
    }
    
    function countEmployees() view public returns (uint) {
        return employeeAccts.length;
    }
    
}
```

## Continuing our Project

We're nearly at the end of the course, but we're going to spend the rest of this lesson by setting up a lite-server and reworking the Web3 UI to work with this new smart contract.

At this point, our contract is written and ready to go. We won't be adding anymore to it in this course. 

We will be installing the MetaMask chrome plugin, which will allow us to connect to the Ropsten test network to more accurately simulate the experience of the dApp on the live Ethereum blockchain. Because of this, we have to install a lite-server in order for MetaMask to inject an instance of the Web3 API. If we don't, MetaMask will not work by just loading our index.html file into the browser straight from the hard drive.

Visit your console in the project folder we've been working in, and use npm to install the lite-server package:

```bash
npm install lite-server --save-dev
```
Next, open up your code editor and inside of the package.json file, add this under scripts:
```json
 "scripts": {    
    "dev": "lite-server"
  },
```
Now, you can run the following command to start the lite-server, which will automatically load the index.html file we've been working on, in your browser at a localhost address:
```console
> npm run dev
```
## Installing MetaMask (skip if already installed)

Going forward, we will use MetaMask, which is a chrome extension that brings Ethereum to your browser. It provides you with a wallet, and the ability to connect to different test networks, as well as the main Ethereum blockchain.

It provides you with a way to interact with decentralized apps by providing you with a way to manage multiple accounts on the live network and test network. It also allows you to sign / approve transactions that are initiated by our Web3 project.

Install the plugin and follow this guide to getting started with setting up the plugin for the first time. You want to get to the point at which you're logged in to the Ropsten test network. If you need to, you can click Buy, which will provide you with free test Ether for use in your project. 

## Deploying the Contract to the Ropsten Test Network

The current state of our Web3 UI project only works with a different version of our contract. We've since updated the contract, so, let's go back to the Remix IDE and redeploy this contract.

Click on Run and change the Environment to Injected Web3. 

This will use MetaMask's injected Web3 instance, which will deploy the contract on the Ropsten test network.

Click Create to deploy the contract. Visit the Compile tab and copy the ABI from the Details button.

Visit our project in your code editor and paste the new ABI code into the following line:

```javascript
var EmployeeContract = web3.eth.contract(PASTE ABI HERE);
```

Then, in the Remix IDE, copy the address associated with the deployed contract.
Paste the new address into the following code here:

```javascript
var EmployeeContract = ...

var Employee = EmployeeContract.at('PASTE ADDRESS HERE');
```

We need to modify the actual HTML to accomodate for our first and last name fields, along with a few other things. Change the actual HTML above our Javascript to the following:

```html
   <div class="container">

        <h1>Employee Employee</h1>
        <span id="countIns"></span>

        <h2 id="employee"></h2>
        <span id="insTrans"></span>
        <hr>

        <img id="loader" src="https://loading.io/spinners/double-ring/lg.double-ring-spinner.gif">

        <label for="fName" class="col-lg-2 control-label">First Name</label>
        <input id="fName" type="text">

        <label for="lName" class="col-lg-2 control-label">Last Name</label>
        <input id="lName" type="text">

        <label for="age" class="col-lg-2 control-label">Employee Age</label>
        <input id="age" type="text">

        <button id="button">Update Employee</button>

    </div>
```

The next line in our Javascript underneath the contract address is where we define a variable for the event. We need to make a slight change;

```javascript
// Change this:
var employeeEvent = Employee.Employee();
```

```javascript
// To this:
var employeeEvent = Employee.employeeInfo({},'latest');
```
The former line worked fine in the ganache environment, but I found that I had to pass in an empty object in the first argument, and a 'latest' string in the second, in order for it to work on the Ropsten network.
This is simply informing the event that we only want the latest event when an employee has been added.
We also need to change the .watch() function associated with that event to:

```javascript
employeeEvent.watch(function (err, result) {
    if (!err) {
        if (result.blockHash != $("#instrans").html()) 
            $("#loader").hide();
            
        $("#insTrans").html('Block hash: ' +result.blockHash);
        $("#employee").html(web3.toAscii(result.args.fName) + ' ' + web3.toAscii(result.args.lName) + ' (' + result.args.age + ' years old)');
    } else {
        $("#loader").hide();
    }
});
```

First, we're checking if the current *.blockHash* is not equal to the blockHash defined in the #instrans ID. If it's not, then and only then will we hide the loading graphic.

Next, we're using a new function called .toAscii, this is because the names are now bytes types, which does not return the actual string value. .toAscii reverts it back.

Underneath this code, let's add a new section that will give us a count on our employees:

```javascript
Employee.countEmployees((err, res) => {
    if (res)
        $("#countIns").html(res.c + ' Employees'); 
});
```
Then, let's update the click event to work with the new function in the smart contract:

```javascript
$("#button").click(function() {
    $("#loader").show();
    Employee.setEmployee(web3.eth.defaultAccount, $("#age").val(), $("#fName").val(),$("#lName").val(), (err, res) => {
        if (err) 
            $("#loader").hide();
});
```
