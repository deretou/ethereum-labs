Lab 7.1: Putting it all Together
===============================

This lab will put everythign toegher 

## Updating the HTML Form
We need to make some minor adjustments to the HTML form in index.html:
```html
   <div class="container">

        <h1>Employee Employee</h1>
        <span id="countIns"></span>

        <h2 id="employee"></h2>
        <span id="insTrans"></span>
        <hr>

        <img id="loader" src="https://loading.io/spinners/double-ring/lg.double-ring-spinner.gif">

        <label for="fName" class="col-lg-2 control-label">First Name</label>
        <input id="fName" type="text">

        <label for="lName" class="col-lg-2 control-label">Last Name</label>
        <input id="lName" type="text">

        <label for="age" class="col-lg-2 control-label">Employee Age</label>
        <input id="age" type="text">

        <button id="button">Update Employee</button>

    </div>
```
If you compare to the code to the previous form, you will find that the changes are minimal. There's simple a first and last name field now, along with a few extra spans with unique ID's.

## Updating the JavaScript

The first line that we have to update from the previous code is the following:

```javascript
// Previous code
var employeeEvent = Employee.Employee();
```

```javascript
// Change ^-- that to:
var employeeEvent = Employee.employeeInfo({}, 'latest');
```
We're changing the name of the event, as that is the new event name that was changed in our smart contract, and we're also passing in an empty object for the first parameter, and 'latest' in the second. 

I found that adding these 2 parameters were necessary in order for it to work correctly on the Ropsten test network. 'latest' simply refers to the last block. In other words, only return successful for the latest event block.

We also have to change the following which is beneath the above line:

```javascript
      employeeEvent.watch(function(error, result) {
           if (result) {
               if (result.blockHash != $("#insTrans").html())
                    $("#loader").hide();

               $("#insTrans").html('Block hash: ' + result.blockHash);
               $("#employee").html(web3.toAscii(result.args.fName) + ' ' + web3.toAscii(result.args.lName) + ' (' + result.args.age + ' years old)');
           } else {
                $("#loader").hide();
           }
       });
```
There's just a few minor changes here. First, we're adding the if statement for result.blockHash so that it only removes the loader if the returned result is an updated blockHash.

Next, we're using .toAscii to convert the bytes16 types that we changed from type string in the previous lesson. .toAscii will make the hex code readable.

Let's also add another function beneath this that gets the number of employees:
```javascript
      Employee.countEmployees((err, res) => {
           if (res)
            $("#countIns").html(res.c + ' Employees');
       })
And then, finally, we will make a slight adjustment in our click event beneath it:
      $("#button").click(function() {
            $("#loader").show();
           Employee.setEmployee(web3.eth.defaultAccount, $("#age").val(), $("#fName").val(), $("#lName").val(), (err, res) => {
               if (err) {
                   $("#loader").hide();
               }
           });
       });
```
The only change here is within the arguments of .setEmployee. We're passing the transaction address, and adding the new fName and lName values.

## Using the App
Now that the smart contract is deployed via MetaMask on the Ropsten Test Network, we can give our app a try in the browser.

First, we set a first name, last name and an age and click Update Employee.

At this point, a MetaMask notification window shows up:

Once we hit Submit, the window disappears and our loading indicator starts waiting for a response from the event callback.

If you click on the MetaMask icon in the browser toolbar, you will see the recent pending transaction. This simply means that the transaction has not yet been verified, and can take anywhere from seconds to minutes:

Once the transaction has been confirmed, the loading indicator disappears and we're able to see the information based back from the event and displayed in the UI.

You've just created your first decentralized app! I would recommend extending this app further to display all of the employee accounts, make them clickable, and display their information somewhere in the UI. 

All of the functions are there for you to use.
