Lab 3.1: Events in Web3js
========================

## Objectives

In the past lesson, our smart contract enabled you to set an Employee name and age. You clicked a catch to present the new information to the contract, yet nothing occurred in our GUI to give us a sign about the status of the exchange.

That is what occasions are used for, which are covered next.

In simple terms, the motivation behind an Event is to give JavaScript callbacks in a UI, which enables you to execute code regardless of whether the occasion was effective, or it caused an error.

In our illustration, the stacking pointer disappeared once the exchange had been affirmed, and the name and age of the teacher were refreshed.

Letâ€™s start off.

## Step 1: Paste the current contract in the Remix IDE:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.18;

contract Employee {
    string fName;
    uint age;

    function setEmployee(string _fName, uint _age) public {
        fName = _fName;
        age = _age;
    }

    function getEmployee() view public returns (string, uint) {
        return (fName, age);
    }
}
```

Note that we have changed it slightly from the last example.

## Step 2: Add an event

We add an event to the contract, just above the setEmployee() function

```solidity
event Employee(
  string name,
  uint age,
);

```

Notice we're passing 2 types that represent the name and age. When the event is
successfully returned in the UI, we can access these values.

## Step 3:  Call the Event fromt the setter method setEmployee()

We need to call this new event from the setter method setEmployee()

```solidity
    function setEmployee(string _fName, uint _age) public {
        fName = _fName;
        age = _age;
	Employee(_fName, _age);  // Add this
    }

``` 

Therefore, when **setEmployee()** is initiated by the user clicking the **Set Employee**
button in our UI, an event is created where we can listen to it through JavaScript

## Step 4: Change Javascript UIU

Here is what our currrente Javascript UI Looks like:

```javascript
if (typeof web3 !== 'undefined') {
    web3 = new Web3(web3.currentProvider);
} else {
    // Set the provider you want from the Web3 providers
    web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider("http://localhost:8545"));
}
// We are adding this additional line here
web3.eth.defaultAccount = web3.eth.accounts[0];
// add this here and make sure to paste in the ABI in Quotes

var employeeContract = web3.eth.contract('PASTE ABI HERE');
var employee = EmployeeContract.at('CONTRACT ADDRESS');
employee.getEmployee(function(error, result) {
    if (!error) {
        $("#employee").html(result[0] + '(' + result[1] + ' years old)');
    } else console.error(error);
});

$("#button").click(function() {
    $("#loader").show()
    employee.setEmployee($("#name").val(), $("#age").val());
});
``` 

Let us make some changes to this.  First, we no longer need to call Employee.getEmployee() so remove that.

Then, we are going to create a variable to reference the event.

```javascript
// Replace the Employee.getEmployee() lines with this line:
var employeeEvent = Employee.Employee();
```

## Step 5:  Make further changes to the javascript

Next, we're going to use the .watch() method on employeeEvent with a callback. Beneath the above line of code, paste this:

```javascript
employeeEvent.watch(function(error, result) {
    if (!error) {
        $("#loader").hide()
        $("#employee").html(result.args.name + ' (' + result.args.age + ' years old)');
    } else {
        $("#loader").hide();
        console.log(error);
    }
});
```

## Step 6: Update index.html and main.css

You will also need to update '~/employee-eth/node_modules/index.html' and '~/employee-eth/node_modules/main.css')

Notice that we're referencing #loader that doesn't yet exist. In the HTML body, paste the following line anywhere in the UI (I put mine beneath the <h2> element):

```html
<img id="loader src="https://loading.io/spinners/double-ring-spinner.gif">
```

In the main.css file, add this 

```css
 #loader {
   width: 100px;
   display:none;
}
```

## Step 7: Ensure you are still running ganache-cli

First, make sure you are still running your ganache-cli in one window. Restart it if not.

## Step 8: Deploy and get updated contract ABI

Use Remix API to deploy, and then get the following:

1. ABI Location
2. Updated smart contract address 

## Step 9: Paste into index.html

Paste the updated ABI location and updated smart contract address in your index.html
file.

## Step 10: View index.html in browser

Open index.html in your browser.  You should be able to enter a name and age and hit "Set Employee."

It will then show the loading graphic, and then it will disappear and you will then see the employee's name 
and age."


## Lab Challenge

Create an event the same as the above Lab, using 3 parameters for calculating percentages on three subjects in which each subject is 100 marks.

## Summary

This chapter has explored how you can you can apply smart contract events to facilitate communication between a DApp and the EVM. Specifically, we have learned how you can define a Solidity event, update the user interface and compile/execute in Remix IDE.
