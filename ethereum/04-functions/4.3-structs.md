Lab 4.3: Structs
========================

## Objectives

A struct in solidity is just a custom type that you can define. You define the struct with a name and associated properties inside of it.


## Creating a Struct
A struct in solidity is just a custom type that you can define. You define the struct with a name and associated properties inside of it.
Start a new file in the Remix IDE called Jobs.sol and paste the following:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.18;

contract Jobs {
    
    struct Employee {
        uint age;
        string fName;
        string lName;
    }
}
```
Here, we have a struct of Employee, which will store their name, first name and last name.

It would also be handy if we could reference each employee by their Ethereum address. That's where we'll create a mapping.

## Creating the Mapping
In Solidity, a mapping is referred to a hash table, which consists of key types and value type pairs. We define a mapping like any other variable type:

```
contract Jobs {
    
    struct Employee {
        uint age;
        string fName;
        string lName;
    }
    
    mapping (address => Employee) employees;
    address[] public employeeAccts;

}
```
Here, we're creating a mapping, which accepts first the key type (in our case, it will be an address type), and the value type will be our Struct that we created above, then we're referring to this mapping as employees.

This will allow us to look up a specific employee with their Ethereum address, and retrieve their age, first name and last name.

The line beneath it is to define an address array that will store all of the employee addresses. This is useful because you currently cannot return a mapping like employees and simply iterate through all of the available employees. Instead, you would have to return a list of employee accounts with employeeAccts and then make a specific function call to grab the Employee's information based on the Ethereum address.

## Adding to a Mapping
Being that our smart contract structure is now significantly different from the previous contract, let's examine what it takes to add a employee to this new format:

```solidity
   // Previous code removed for brevity
    
    function setEmployee(address _address, uint _age, string _fName, string _lName) public {
        var employee = employees[_address];

        employee.age = _age;
        employee.fName = _fName;
        employee.lName = _lName;
        
        employeeAccts.push(_address) -1;

    }
```

In the arguments, we're passing an address, age, first name and last name; simple enough.
Next, we're creating a variable employee and binding it to the employees mapping and passing in the _address as the key.

We then set the age, first and last name.

At the end, we push the new employee address to the array of addresses employeeAccts.

## Getting from a Mapping

We can now add new employees to our mapping, but what if we wanted to retrieve them? Well, first we'll create a function that returns a list of addresses from employeeAccts:

```solidity
   // Other code removed for brevity

    function getEmployees() view public returns (address[]) {
        return employeeAccts;
    }
```

Now that we have access to specific accounts, we can create another function beneath it that will retrieve a specific employee based on a provided address:

```solidity
   function getEmployees() view public returns (address[]) {
        return employeeAccts;
    }

    function getEmployee(address ins) view public returns (uint, string, string) {
        return (employees[ins].age, employees[ins].fName, employees[ins].lName);
    }
```
Create the contract, copy the account address with the account used to create the contract, and enter this into setEmployee: "ethaddress", 34, "Buck", "Rogers"  and click the setEmployee button.

Then, click on the getEmployees button. This will provide you with the address you entered.  Copy it, and then paste it with quotes surrounding it into the getEmployee textfield, and click the button.  

It should return with the age, first name and last name of the provided account.
Go ahead and add another employee with a different account from the list of accounts above and try it out!

## Counting from a Mapping

It would be nice to know how many employees we have, so let's create a function for that:

```solidity
   function getEmployees() view public returns (address[]) {
        return employeeAccts;
    }

    function getEmployee(address ins) view public returns (uint, string, string) {
        return (employees[ins].age, employees[ins].fName, employees[ins].lName);
    }

    function countEmployees() view public returns (uint) {
        return employeeAccts.length;
    }
```

Re-create the contract, add a new employee and click countEmployees, simple enough!

### The Full Contract
Here is the full contract so far:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.18;

contract Jobs {
    
    struct Employee {
        uint age;
        string fName;
        string lName;
    }
    
    mapping (address => Employee) employees;
    address[] public employeeAccts;
    
    function setEmployee(address _address, uint _age, string _fName, string _lName) public {
        var employee = employees[_address];
        
        employee.age = _age;
        employee.fName = _fName;
        employee.lName = _lName;
        
        employeeAccts.push(_address) -1;
    }
    
    function getEmployees() view public returns(address[]) {
        return employeeAccts;
    }
    
    function getEmployee(address _address) view public returns (uint, string, string) {
        return (employees[_address].age, employees[_address].fName, employees[_address].lName);
    }
    
    function countEmployees() view public returns (uint) {
        return employeeAccts.length;
```
