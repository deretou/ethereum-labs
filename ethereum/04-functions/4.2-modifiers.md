Lab 4.2: Modifiers
========================

## Objectives

In this chapter, we will learn how to use another important function, which are work modifiers.

A modifier enables you to control the conduct of your smart contract capacities. It incorporates an assortment of utilization cases, for example, confining who can run a given capacity, opening capacities at a specific time allotment, and so forth.  

For our situation, we will make a modifier that permits only the contract proprietor to run a given capacity. With regards to our task, this will mean only enabling the contract proprietor to get the setEmployee() work.

This simple instructional exercise is simply one more piece of the creation of a smart contract.

It's very straightforward; it enables you to set an employee's name and age. We can likewise interface with this smart contract through a web3 UI.

To further illustrate Mappings and Structs, we will restructure our smart contract to take into consideration including numerous employees, including recovering the information related with them considering their record as a key.


## Step 1: Create Employees Contract

Open up your employees.sol contract in Remix IDE:

Here is what it should look like:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.18;

contract Employee {
    string fName;
    uint age;

    event Employee(
        string name,
        uint age,
    );

    function setEmployee(string _fName, uint _age) public {
        fName = _fName;
        age = _age;
        Employee(_fName, _age)
    }

    function getEmployee() view public returns (string, uint) {
        return (fName, age);
    }
}
```

Function modifiers in smart contracts can be utilized for an assortment of purposes. For this example, we will make a modifier that will enable the proprietor of the contract to set the employee name and age through the setEmployee () function.


## Step 2: Add an address to the contract

To do this, we initially need to characterize another variable as a sort of address:

```solidity
contract Employee {
    string fName;
    uint age;
    address owner;  // Add this

    event Employee(
        string name,
        uint age,
    );

    function setEmployee(string _fName, uint _age) public {
        fName = _fName;
        age = _age;
        Employee(_fName, _age);
    }

    function getEmployee() view public returns (string, uint) {
        return (fName, age);
    }
}
```

## Step 3:  Add a constructor function

We need to add a constructor function to the new contract.

```solidity
    function Employee() public { // Add this Constructor
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
```

## Step 4: Add a modifier to the contract

Put this under the new constructor:

```solidity
    modifier onlyOwner {
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        _;
    }

```

This way, to make a modifier, you begin by expressing the modifier and the name of the modifier. For our situation, it will be onlyOwner which can utilize various circumstances as a modifier relying upon your details.

Note: Modifiers can likewise have contentions, ie: modifier name(arg1)

Within our modifier, we're stating require() which is a method for saying, "if the condition isn't valid, toss an exemption".

If the condition is valid, _; hanging underneath in the place the function body is set, the function will be executed.

## Step 5:  Use the new Modifier

We've made a modifier, now what? We can utilize it in any function where we just need the smart contract maker to approach.

How about we add it to the setEmployee () function:

```solidity
    function setEmployee(string _fName, uint _age) onlyOwner public {
        fName = _fName;
        age = _age;
        Employee(_fName, _age);
    }


```

##  Step 6: Test the result in Remix IDE


To try this using the Remix IDE, tap the Create catch to make the contract. At that point, determine "Gary", 44 in the setEmployee function textfield on the privilege of the IDE and tap on the function name to set it.

To confirm, click getEmployee.

## Step 7: Try an invalid record in Remix IDE:


Change this: 

```javascript

$("#button").click(function() {
    $("#loader").show()
    employee.setEmployee($("#name").val(), $("#age").val()); // Change this
});

```

To this:

```javascript
$("#button").click(function() {
            $("#loader").show()
            employee.setEmployee($("#name").val(), $("#age").val(), (err, res) => {  // To This
                    if (err) {
                        $("#loader").hide();
                        console.log('oh no!');
                    }
                }
            });
```

Next, try changing the Account dropdown to an unexpected record in comparison to the one used to make the smart contract and rehash the procedure above.

You'll see it won't work this time, the debugger will toss out a mistake.
