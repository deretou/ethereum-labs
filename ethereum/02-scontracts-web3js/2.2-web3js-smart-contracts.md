Lab 2.2: Web.js Smart Contracts
===============================

## Step 1: Ensure ganache-cli is running

If you did lab 2.1, you should have ganache-cli currently running. If you do not, the following in a new window:

```bash
ganache-cli
```

## Step 2: Change Environment in Remix

Switch over to the Remix IDE, click on the Run tab, and then change the Environment dropdown from Javascript VM to Web3 Provider.

Hit "OK" and then specify the ganache localhost address (by default, it's http://localhost:8545)

This means that instead of deploying and testing in the Javascript VM, we're now using the ganache client on your computer.

Open up a new file called Employee.sol (if you have not already done so).

Paste the following:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.18;

contract Employee {
    string fName;
    uint age;

    function setEmployee(string _fName, uint _age) public {
        fName = _fName;
        age = _age;
    }

    function getEmployee() view public returns (string, uint) {
        return (fName, age);
    }
}
```

(For your convenience, the contents of this file are here in the repo in the employee-eth/ directory.)

Click on "Start to Compile".  When finished, click on the "run" tab and
then "Deploy."  Keep this open, as we will need the address shortly.

You will need to make a note of the **contract address** from the deploy tab. You will need this in step 5. 

## Step 3: Create a new index.html file and main.css file

Go to the employee_eth/node_modules directory.

```bash
cd ~/employee_eth/node_modules
```

Create a new file called 'index.html' in the directory ~/employee_eth/node_modules:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <title>Document</title>

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="main.css">

    <script src="./web3/dist/web3.min.js"></script>

</head>

<body>
    <div class="container">

        <h1>employee Employee</h1>

        <h2 id="employee"></h2>

        <label for="name" class="col-lg-2 control-label">Employee Name</label>
        <input id="name" type="text">

        <label for="name" class="col-lg-2 control-label">Employee Age</label>
        <input id="age" type="text">

        <button id="button">Update Employee</button>


    </div>

    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js"></script>
    <script>
        // Our future code here
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

Create a 'main.css' file as follows:

```css
body {
     background-color:#F0F0F0;
     padding: 2em;
     font-family: 'Raleway','Source Sans Pro','Arial';
}
 .container {
     width: 50%;
     margin: auto;
}
 label {
     display:block;
     margin-bottom:10px;
}
 input {
     padding: 10px;
     width: 50%;
     margin-bottom: 1em;
}
 button {
     margin: 2em 0;
     padding: 1em 4em;
     display:block;
}
 #employee {
     padding: 1em;
     background-color: #fff;
     margin: 1em 0;
}

```
(For your convenience, the contents of [index.html](./employee_eth/index.html) and [main.css](./employee_eth/main.css) are [here](./employee_eth) in the repo in the employee-eth/ directory.)


In the index.html file, insert the following script, in the place where we said our script goes here.

Going back to the index.html, at the bottom of the file we have an empty <script> tag. This is where we will write the necessary code to work with our smart contract.
In the head tags in index.html, we're already importing the Web3.js library, so now, let's update our code and use it to connect to our ganache client:


```javascript
if (typeof web3 !== 'undefined') {
  web3 = new Web3(web3.currentProvider);
} else {
  // set the provider you want from Web3.providers
  web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider("http://localhost:8545"));
}
```

Test to make sure the index.html shows properly.

It's saying that if web3 is not undefined, then we'll use that as our provider. If it's undefined (else), we can manually specify the provider ourselves.

You may be wondering, how would web3 be defined? Well, if you're using the Chrome extension MetaMask(which we will use later in this course) or an Ethereum browser like Mist, the provider is automatically injected.  In other words, MetaMask and Mist use Web3 to connect to the blockchain.


## Step 4: Compose a new script

Next, we have to specify a default ethereum account to use through the web3.eth.defaultAccount method:

Add the following:

```javascript
if (typeof web3 !== 'undefined') {
    web3 = new Web3(web3.currentProvider);
} else {
    // Set the provider you want from the Web3 providers
    web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider("http://localhost:8545"));
}
// We are adding this additional line ehre
web3.eth.defaultAccount = web3.eth.accounts[0];
// add this here and make sure to paste in the ABI in Quotes

var employeeContract = web3.eth.contract('PASTE ABI HERE');
```

Remember when we ran the ganache-cli console command? It provided us with 10
accounts. We're simply choosing the first account here to use.
Next, we need to use the web3.eth.contract () method to initialize (or create) the
contract on an address. It accepts one parameter, which is referred to as the ABI
(Application Binary Interface).

This ABI allows you to call functions and receive data from your smart contract.

Go back to Remix and click on the Compile tab, then click on Details. Scroll down until you
see the interface - ABI section and click the copy icon.

Make an note of this ABI for the next step.

It will look something like this:

```javascript
[ { "constant": true, "inputs": [], "name": "getEmployee", "outputs": [ { "name": "", "type": "string" }, { "name": "", "type": "uint256" } ], "payable": false, "stateMutability": "view", "type": "function" }, { "constant": false, "inputs": [ { "name": "_fName", "type": "string" }, { "name": "_age", "type": "uint256" } ], "name": "setEmployee", "outputs": [], "payable": false, "stateMutability": "nonpayable", "type": "function" } ]
```

## Step 5: Add new lines to the index.html

Add these lines to your index.html script code you created before.

```javascript
if (typeof web3 !== 'undefined') {
    web3 = new Web3(web3.currentProvider);
} else {
    // Set the provider you want from the Web3 providers
    web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider("http://localhost:8545"));
}
// We are adding this additional line here
web3.eth.defaultAccount = web3.eth.accounts[0];
// add this here and make sure to paste in the ABI in Quotes
var employeeContract  = web3.eth.contract('YOUR ABI HERE'); // Don't include the ABI in single quotes
var employee = employeeContract.at('Paste Contract Address Here');
console.log(employee);
```

You will need to cut and paste two **VERY IMPORTANT** items:
1. The ABI you got from the previous step (Step 4).
2. The Contract address you got from REMIX IDE Run tab in step 2.

## Step 6: Run the html in the browser

Great. Let's save this, and then (in Sublime Text or Visual Studio Code) you can right-click or double click on the index.html and Reveal in a browser. Double click the index.html to run it in the browser.

CTRL-SHIFT-I (i) will show the debug console console. You will see something similar to the following:

Notice our two functions: getEmployee and setEmployee

Use the javascript console window within the inspector.  

**Note that the form does not work yet, but you are able to reach the blockchain from the browser. You will  be able to connect to the blockchain from the form later.**

You should see something like this:

```console
> employee.setEmployee('Foo', 44) // Hit Enter
"0x894..." // This is the response address
> employee.getEmployee()
(2) ["Foo",e] An array containing our data

```


## Step 7: Let's use Jquery 

But let's use jQuery to make these calls for us based on our form (this ties the gui components to the blockchain):
Add the following to our script:

```javascript
if (typeof web3 !== 'undefined') {
    web3 = new Web3(web3.currentProvider);
} else {
    // Set the provider you want from the Web3 providers
    web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider("http://localhost:8545"));
}
// We are adding this additional line here
web3.eth.defaultAccount = web3.eth.accounts[0];
// add this here and make sure to paste in the ABI in Quotes

var employeeContract = web3.eth.contract('PASTE ABI HERE');
employee.getTitle(function(error, result) {
    if (!error) {
        $("#employee").html(result[0]+' ('+result[1]+' years old)');
        console.log(result);
    } else console.error(error);
});

$("#button").click(function() {
    employee.setEmployee($("#name").val(), $("#age").val());
});
```

We're simply calling .getPublic and passing the error and result through a callback
function. If the error isn't present, we set the html of an h2 element with the id of
#title to the returned result array (0 = the name, 1 = the age).

Next, on click, we call .setPublic to the title and description values from the
input fields in the form.

Save it, refresh and see the change!

## Lab Challenge
Create a UI for Smart Contracts that interact with W3.js Also, enable all the modules for node.js

## Summary

We have successfully programmed, compiled, deployed and executedsmart contracts on the Ethereum Blockchain using Web3.Js as the development framework. Even though the overall work-flow is similar to that of Remix; you have to use the node console and Web3.Js to interface with the Blockchain on ganache- cli.
Next up, we explore smart contract events with Web3.Js.
