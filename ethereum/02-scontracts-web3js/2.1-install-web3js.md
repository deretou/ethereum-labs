Lab 2.1:  Install Ganache-cli
=====================================

### Step 1: Install npm and node.js is not already installed

On Ubuntu 16.04, you can execute the following: (if you did not do this already in lab 1.2

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get install nodejs npm curl
```

Now check the version of node.js

```bash
nodejs --version
```
If the version is less than v.8.11.1, then execute the the following:

```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
```

Then execute this:

```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
```


## Step 2: Install the Node Module ganache-cli

First install ganache-cli

```bash
sudo npm install -g ganache-cli #formally known as ethereum-testrpc 
```

Ignore this ugly warning, which will show up if you install on Linux or Windows

```console

```
 
fsevents is a module for Mac OS X and iOS platforms that is not needed on non-apple hardware.

## Step 3: Run ganache-cli

Open up a window that you can leave running (a new putty window or Terminal Window).

In this window: run ganache-cli

```bash
ganache-cli
```

Then leave this running, and **DO NOT CLOSE IT**.  You can continue the lab in another window.

You should see the results something like the following:

```console
Ganache CLI v6.1.0 (ganache-core: 2.1.0)

## Step 4: Make and Initialize a project directory

```bash
cd
mkdir employee-eth
cd employee-eth
```


## Step 5: Run the npm init command 

Run the npm init command in this new directory, which will create package.json file.

```bash
cd ~/employee-eth
npm init
```

Continue to hit enter through all the prompts required.


## Step 6:  Install Web3.js

```bash
cd ~/employee-eth
npm -install ethereum/web3.js --save
```

Do not worry about the following

```console
npm WARN employee-eth@1.0.0 No description
npm WARN employee-eth@1.0.0 No repository field.
```
